- About
-------
Defrag is a modification for Quake 3 Arena dedicated to player movements and tricks-jumping in a broad sense. It aims at providing a convenient platform for self-training, competition, online tricking, movie making, and more generally for the fun of tricks-jumping. The mod sports a wide variety of features from timers and meters to ghost mode and cheat prevention. Specially crafted maps are provided that will rely on your movement abilities to be completed up to the finish line, while we still haven't forgotten to support standard Quake3 maps and CTF fast captures. Player physics from both the original Quake3 and the CPMa mod are supported.

Defrag resources, maps, and scoreboards can be found on the official website at http://planetquake.com/defrag.


- Installation
--------------
Defrag requires Quake 3 Arena point release 1.27 or any later version. Extract the archive contents into your Quake3 directory, with respect for the directory structure. The mod data will be extracted into a Defrag subdirectory, and can then be loaded from the Mods menu.

Once properly installed, geeks might be pleased to know that Defrag can be loaded from the command line with the following parameters:
quake3.exe +set fs_game defrag

Enjoy.


- Finding help
--------------
Starting a game is a matter of clicking around, and most of the settings are accessible through the menu. However, if you are seeking for scripting capabilities, advanced features, or just got addicted to the /man/ Unix command, you may want to parse the \docs directory for details. If you have some interest in mapping or camera scripting, the \misc directory will come in handy. Besides, you may consider using the /help and /read commands within the Quake3 console.
