Excessive Plus v2.3 (Jun 20 2014)
=================================

add: xp_antiWallhackLevel 0..5 (default: 0)
	
	Can make wallhacks useless.

	It can be configured for levels 0..5 where level 0 is
	disabled, level 1 is least strict (e.g. it will	play
	most sounds like footsteps) and level 5 is most strict.

	Keep in mind that it will also reduce game quality
	for regular players due to missing sounds and other
	effects.

fix: more accurate on-ground unlagged code

add: scoreboard now shows Anti-Cheat and Anti-Wallhack level, if
	enabled on the server

chg: scoreboard now has avg. score and avg. kills instead of
	player count and avg. ping

fix: bans parser failed on complex entries

fix: warmup() in settings config failed on /rcon load

add: some functions to improve scripting in callvote, rotation or crontab

	mapTime()				Map time in seconds.

	teamCount( teamId )		Amount of players in team. teamId can be 1, 2,
							TEAM_RED or TEAM_BLUE.

	teamScore( [teamId] )	Team score. teamId is optional. If omitted it
							will be the sum of red + blue score.

	getTeam()				Only available in callvote. Returns the team
							of the caller.

fix: do not play jump sounds for spectators (with PHYSICS_STEP_JUMPS)

fix: more accurate xp_improvePrediction

fix: /ref whois crash for specific dates

fix: wrong spawn protection for projectiles

fix: crash on unknown gametypes when /startrecord or /screenshotXP format

	in non-team games.

add: /unmute enemy

add: "Timeout -> Amount" default 3 per team and player (1on1)

add: "Timeout -> Time" default 120 seconds for teams (or 60 in 1on1)

fix: player positions after timeout/pause

chg: reduced visual glitches during timeout/pause

fix: /vid_restart, /togglefullscreen, Alt+Enter during timeout/pause

chg: referees can override or extend timeout

chg: /ref pause cannot be canceled by players anymore (using /ready)

fix: Start "dead" on join in Clan Arena

chg: "Impact Score" now includes absorbed armor damage

chg: thawing sound and now also active during whole thaw process

add: "Freeze Tag -> Thaw Walls" default disabled

	If enabled allows thawing through walls/floor.

add: "Freeze Tag -> Helper Factor" default 0.5

	Time factor applied if there is more than one thawer.

      0 - Only allow one thawer, no helpers
    > 0 - Additional helpers will thaw with this factor applied
          A value of 0.5 means 1.5 times faster with 2 thawers,
          2 times faster with 3 thawers etc.
    < 0 - Penalty for additional helpers, the thaw will take longer
          with more thawers or even negate the thaw

add: Teleport of frozen bodies

	If enabled, it will teleport the frozen body back to the last
	known "stable" position. If this position is occupied by a player
	or another frozen body, nothing will happen. The body will continue
	to thaw as defined (e.g. by Void Thaw Time).

	As soon as the position becomes available, the frozen body will
	teleport there.

add: "Freeze Tag -> Void Teleport" default enabled

add: "Freeze Tag -> Lava Teleport" default disabled

add: "Freeze Tag -> Slime Teleport" default disabled

add: "Freeze Tag -> Water Teleport" default disabled

	no need to disable/enable the console manually when changing server

chg: xp_modelScale now 0, 0.5..1.0



Excessive Plus v2.2a (Jun 30 2011)
==================================

fix: client crash on some conditions

fix: exploit



Excessive Plus v2.2 (Jun 26 2011)
=================================

Client / UI

add: xp_drawConsole "bitmask" (default: 3)
	
	will replace the engine console with a custom one, which allows
	extended color codes to be displayed
	
	1		enable the console
	2		filter out most debug/info messages
	4		do not scale the font size

add: Wallhack2 command along with wallhackPassword cvar, available
	for spectators (it will draw green bbox for live enemies only)

chg: bring back cg_optimizePrediction option (turned on by default)

chg: renamed some countries to match ISO 3166-2, see below

add: some country flags
	
	Saint Martin (MF) (unofficial)
	
	United Kingdom (GB)
	England (GB-ENG)
	Northern Ireland (GB-NIR)
	Scotland (GB-SCT)
	Wales (GB-WLS)
	
	Baden-Wuerttemberg (DE-BW)
	Bayern (DE-BY)
	Berlin (DE-BE)
	Brandenburg (DE-BB)
	Bremen (DE-HB)
	Hamburg (DE-HH)
	Hessen (DE-HE)
	Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (DE-MV)
	Niedersachsen (DE-NI)
	Nordrhein-Westfalen (DE-NW)
	Rheinland-Pflaz (DE-RP)
	Saarland (DE-SL)
	Sachsen (DE-SN)
	Sachsen-Anhalt (DE-ST)
	Schleswig-Holstein (DE-SH)
	Thueringen (DE-TH)

add: more chat tokens
	
	$(health)
	$(armor)
	$(ammo)
	$(corpse) - your last death location
	$(attacker) - name of your last attacker
	$(target) - name of your last (hit) target
	$(pickup) - last item you took
	$(item) - item close to you
	$(itemCrosshair) - item close to your crosshair
	$(location) - nearest item spawn
	$(friend) - friend close to you
	
	these can be used within "/say" and "/say_team"

add: xp_enemySound "model" (default: "")
	
	where model can be any valid model e.g. "sarge", "keel", "grunt" etc.
	an empty value "" will disable it and the sounds of the actual
	enemy model will be used

fix: team chat overflow

fix: xp_drawNames in combination with xp_drawMVDWindow

add: xp_ambient 0/1 to turn off ambient sounds

chg: thaw status (team overlay) now better visible for custom HUDs

add: xp_modelScale 0, 0.5..2.0 (default: 0)
	scales player models client-side
	
	a value of "0" will try to fit the model into the hitbox
	a value of "1" will keep the behaviour of previous Excessive Plus
	versions
	
	keep in mind that this is client-side only, e.g. a value of "1.5" will
	make the models look "big and easy to hit" but the hitbox remains
	as defined by the server

add: xp_modelJump 0/1 (default: 1)
	enables/disables jump animations client-side
	
	most (all default) quake 3 models do use very odd jump animations,
	which do not align to the hitbox. aiming towards the head will most
	probably result in a miss, when the enemy is jumping
	
	with disabled jump animations you of course will still see players
	jumping around but it will look different and their model will fit to
	the actual hitbox

fix: various crouching/duck animations to keep the model aligned to
	the hitbox

fix: step animation with better aligned crosshair

chg: xp_noBobbing "bitmask" (default: 0)

	1	disables weapon bobbing animation
	2	disables weapon switch animation
	4	disables weapon firing knockback animation
	8	disables damage kick

fix: added default "hud1-7.cfg" to pk3, to have them available on a pure
	server

chg: "/away" will append "-away" to your name

add: "/back" as the counterpart to /away to get back your nickname



Server

chg: all configuration files now use the advanced parser engine and share
	a common syntax. no need to learn multiple syntax anymore, all common
	functions are available everywhere etc.

fix: teamed items not spawned if XP_WARMUPRESPAWN_ITEMS is used

fix: reload map if hot-switched to pure

fix: long wav names in /say command may cause server malfunction

add: SelfKnockbackCycle, SelfKnockbackMultiJumps weapon config options

chg: custom entity files now use same syntax as config files
	so you can use complex if-else constructs etc.

add: "Config -> Version"

add: random() function
	
	returns a random number between 0 and 1. optionally takes 2 arguments
	random(min, max) which will return a random number between min and max

add: activeClients() function, also deprecated $xp_activeClients
	
	using it will issue a warning and the variable will be removed
	in a later version, upgrade your rotations to activeClients()
	
	will return the number of active "playing" clients/players, useful for
	rotations, e.g. "if ( activeClients() >= 8 ) { q3dm11 }"
	
	the server will only rotate to q3dm11 if there are at least 8 players

chg: rotation now use same syntax as config files
	
	you can have complex if-else constructs and conditional
	maps finally work as you would expect them to
	
	additionally you can access all config attributes
	as read-only (no assignment) e.g. "Machinegun->Damage"
	
	example:
	q3dm1
	q3dm2
	if ( activeClients() >= 8 ) { q3dm11 }
	q3dm3
	
	no need to even out map count in an tricky "else { ... }" block. add
	conditions just as you need them and they will work naturally

add: PW_FIRST_SPAWN to Start Powerups

fix: excessive3.cfg and excessive4.cfg (PW_FIRST_SPAWN)

chg: crontab now use same syntax as config files, complex if-else etc.

add: DM_DAMAGE_THRU_FLOOR

fix: all chat messages get properly en/decoded

fix: crouching players now have correct bbox when frozen

add: "Freeze Tag -> Movable"

add: "Freeze Tag -> Solid" to make frozen bodies act like shields
	against railgun

add: "Freeze Tag -> Score Penalty" scoring team has to manually thaw
	team mates

add: "Freeze Tag -> Round Delay"

add: "Freeze Tag -> Slithery"

fix: when timelimit is hit, no matter what value "Round Delay" was
	set to, the team will instantly score if all enemys are frozen

fix: frozen bodies could fall through curved solids

add: ban files can "include()" other ban files
	other than that, no complex if-else constructs etc. available here

add: /ban, /banname, /banip and /banguid now capable of temporary bans
	
	the time can be "Xw" for weeks, "Xd" for days, "Xh" for hours,
	"Xm" for minutes or just "X" for days
	
	example: /ban <playerId> 2h stop the spam!
	         /ban <playerId> you are permanently banned!

add: xp_floodProtectUserinfo 0/1 (default: 0)
	userinfo anti-flood protection. when enabled it allows renaming
	3 times per 3 seconds and changing other info 5 times per 3 seconds

add: date() function
	can be used to have crontab independent settings based on date/time
	for the complete format specs see "www.php.net/strftime"
	
	example: if ( date("%d.%m") == "24.12" ) { /*add some xmas special*/ }

add: "Round -> Mode" (MODE_WARMUP/MODE_INTERMISSION)
	unlike "xp_matchmode 2/3" this applies to all team games except TDM
	
	a config can create e.g. round based CTF with warmup in between the
	rounds. you can even use a combination of both modes
	
	this is independent of "roundlimit" and thus will also work for
	"fraglimit", "capturelimit" or even with all of them set to "0"

rem: removed xp_matchMode "2" and "3"
	now 0/1 only to enable the advanced options like "/timeout" etc.
	
	the former modes "2" and "3" are reproducible by "Round -> Mode"

chg: "roundlimit" applies to all gametypes
	unlike the name might suggest, this is completely independent of round
	based gameplay. it's just an alternative to "fraglimit" and
	"capturelimit" to "shorten" public games
	
	it has always precedence over "fraglimit" and "capturelimit" e.g.
	roundlimit = 10 on CTF, then the game will end either when the
	difference between BLUE and RED is 50% (5 rounds, high lead) or the
	sum of BLUE + RED hits the roundlimit (5 + 5, the game will end draw
	if sudden death has been disabled)
	
	set it to "0" to give "fraglimit" and "capturelimit" the precedence

fix: "Hitbox" value should not touch the height

add: "Hitbox Cylinder" to replace the cuboid hitbox with a cylinder
	
	note: to simplify things, cg_drawBBox will use an outer octagonal prism
	to represent the cylinder used by the server

add: PHYSICS_QUAKE_LIVE, PHYSICS_AIR_STEPS and PHYSICS_STEP_JUMPS
	you will want to add all of them for a QL-alike config
	
	note: not all maps will fit PHYSICS_QUAKE_LIVE, e.g. you can walk off
	the blue/red platform (q3ctf4) into your death without jumping, while
	the platform borders on q3dm17 will just work fine. it is suggested to
	keep this disabled, even for QL-alike configs, as it requires different
	map design and might fail for random maps in Quake 3

rem: PHYSICS_NO_RAMP_JUMPS

add: PHYSICS_RAMP_JUMPS and PHYSICS_DOUBLE_JUMPS
	previously double jumps were bundled with ramp jumps
	
	upgrade from v2.1 to v2.2: (this affects almost all configs)
	if you had PHYSICS_NO_RAMP_JUMPS set, just drop it. otherwise you will
	need to add both PHYSICS_RAMP_JUMPS and PHYSICS_DOUBLE_JUMPS to your
	$xp_physics cvar

add: "Impact Score" to receive additional score points based on
	inflicted damage

add: "Range", "Falloff Range" and "Falloff Factor" to all hit-scan weapons

add: DM_VOID_RESPAWN

add: "PATTERN_TIGHT" and "PATTERN_CENTER" to SG fixed pattern

chg: "Shotgun -> Fixed Pattern"
	
	example:
		QL:   PelletCount = 20; FixedPattern = 3; Spread = 1000;
		CPMA: PelletCount = 16; FixedPattern = 2 | PATTERN_TIGHT;

add: pmove_accurate 0/1, 30..125 (default: 0)
	
	an alternative to pmove_fixed which had some drawbacks like the choppy
	movement or missing sounds
	
	enabling this will get rid of frame-rate dependent physics and be fair
	for everyone. however it will require more bandwidth and make people
	(with "com_maxfps 125") no longer jump as high and far as they were
	used to before
	
	to solve this, you can set pmove_accurate to a value of "125". this
	will effectively make all players jump as high and far as if they had
	125 fps even when their actual fps is lower or unstable

add: xp_antiCheatLevel 0..5 (default: 0)
	
	It will detect and kick users of some 'popular' cheats like classic
	aimbots and autoshooters.
	
	AntiCheat system is controlled with xp_antiCheatLevel variable.
	It can be setup for levels 0..5 where
	level 0 means AntiCheat is off (never does kick),
	level 1 means maximum tolerance (least strict)
	and level 5 means minimum tolerance (most strict)
	
	Level 3 is optimal for public servers, while higher levels
	may result to kicking normal players using broken hardware

rem: removed xp_voteconf and voteconf.txt

add: advanced callvote and referee commands
	
	admins now have full control over callvotes. they can restrict the
	command itself, it's voteable values (e.g. only g_gametype ffa or ctf)
	and even create own, very custom, server specific votes
	
	to use the advanced system, xp_vote and/or xp_referee have to point
	to a file, e.g. "/set xp_vote callvote.txt"
	
	see callvote.txt for the syntax

fix: referees are no longer affected by callvote limits, they can also
	callvote as spectators

add: in combination with the advanced callvote, referees can callvote
	their ref commands

add: firstTime() function
	tells whether it is the first load of a config
	
	it is strongly suggested to have any cvar assignment in such a block,
	to give server admins more control over the config. otherwise it will
	most definitely result in multiple/modified configs per server
	
	example:
	if ( firstTime() ) {
		$xp_chatProtection = no;
		$xp_unlagged = yes;
	}
	
	the server admin can disable unlagged or enable chat protection at any
	time (without modifying the .cfg file) and the config will respect his
	decision, not resetting the values on the very next map rotation

add: warmup() function
	
	allows to have different settings during warmup. this will only apply
	to real warmups not "Round -> Warmup"
	
	example:
	if ( warmup() ) {
		DM Flags |= DM_INFINITE_AMMO;
	}

chg: xp_teamBalance 0/1/2 (default: 1)
	
	0	do not balance teams after a match
	1	balance by score + kills per hour
	2	balance by score

add: /teamBalance 1/2
	
	you can /callvote, /ref or /rcon this to balance teams during a match
	
	the match continues with all the stats intact (score, awards etc.) but
	players will respawn at the base and possibly in a different team

add: "World Damage -> Hurt"
